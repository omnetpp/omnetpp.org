This release focuses on incremental improvements and refinements rather than
introducing major new features. Key enhancements include Analysis Tool
improvements such as configurable bin setup for "histogram from vectors" charts,
global menu support in Qtenv, enhanced dark theme support throughout the IDE,
and various other usability and stability improvements across the platform.

Issues [fixed](https://github.com/omnetpp/omnetpp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A6.3) in version 6.3.0.
