excerpt: 'Remote OMNeT++ developed by Márk Erdei, Ambrus Wagner, Katalin Sója and
  Márk Székely at the Technical University of Budapest. The framework supports managing
  remote simulation runs on a cluster of workstations. A Remote OMNeT++ system consists
  of simulation execution hosts (workhorses) and data warehouse hosts (for storing
  model files and simulation results) accessed via Remote OMNeT++ clients. The idea
  is similar to that of grid computing. The implementation uses Java, Swing and RMI.
