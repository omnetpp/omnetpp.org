Rostock, Germany - The OMNeT++ development team was invited to present a tutorial on Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) at the 21st IEEE International Conference on Factory Communication Systems (WFCS 2025). The conference took place in Rostock, Germany, from June 10-13, 2025.

The 90-minute tutorial, "Simulating Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) with OMNeT++ and INET," was held on the conference's Tutorial Day. It was presented by Levente Mészáros, a Senior Software Engineer for the OMNeT++/INET Framework.

The session provided a practical introduction to simulating TSN technologies using the OMNeT++ discrete-event simulator and the INET Framework model library. The presentation gave an overview of OMNeT++ simulation concepts and demonstrated how the INET Framework facilitates the modeling of TSN networks and traffic. The tutorial highlighted key TSN scenarios through live demonstrations, covering cut-through switching, frame preemption, scheduling and traffic shaping, and time synchronisation, among other topics.

The tutorial was designed for researchers, graduate students, and industry practitioners looking to evaluate TSN solutions. It aimed to provide attendees with a practical understanding of how to model and assess key TSN mechanisms. The goal was for participants to feel confident in building their own TSN simulations, configuring relevant parameters, and using the results to guide design and implementation decisions.

As the only IEEE conference exclusively focused on communication for industrial automation systems, WFCS was an ideal venue to showcase the powerful capabilities of OMNeT++ and INET for TSN research and development.
