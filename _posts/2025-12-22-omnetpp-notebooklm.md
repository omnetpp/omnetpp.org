title: Chat with the AI - an OMNeT++ NotebookLM
category: Software

excerpt: |
    We have added a new resource to assist users with learning OMNeT++ and writing their simulation projects. Located under the "Asking Questions" section, the OMNeT++ NotebookLM (https://nb.omnetpp.org) offers a dedicated Google Gemini powered notebook loaded with a collection of OMNeT++ and INET documentation. We will keep this notebook updated with the latest features and capabilities of the simulator. If you have any questions or need help with your simulation projects, please try this tool first. We ourselves use it for our daily work.

We have added a new resource to assist users with learning OMNeT++ and writing their simulation projects. Located under the "Asking Questions" section, the OMNeT++ NotebookLM (https://nb.omnetpp.org) offers a dedicated Google Gemini powered notebook loaded with a collection of OMNeT++ and INET documentation. We will keep this notebook updated with the latest features and capabilities of the simulator. If you have any questions or need help with your simulation projects, please try this tool first.

## Example Prompts to Try:
Here are several technical prompts you can use to test the notebook's capabilities across different areas of the simulator:

### NED & Topology

> Create a NED module for a wireless sensor node that includes a transceiver, a battery module, and an application layer. Show how to connect them using gates.

> Explain the difference between types and submodules in a compound module. Can you give a code example of a parametric submodule?

### C++ & Simulation Kernel

> How do I schedule a self-message to trigger an event every 0.5 seconds in my handleMessage function?

> Write a C++ class that extends cSimpleModule and records a histogram of packet inter-arrival times.

### INET Framework Configuration

> How do I configure omnetpp.ini to set up a static routing table for a network of 5 routers using the INET Framework?

> What are the necessary parameters to enable 802.11g mode in Ieee80211Interface?

### Debugging & Analysis

> I am getting a checkout error regarding 'simulation time limit reached'. How can I properly handle or extend the simulation time limit in the configuration file?

> How can I export my vector data to a CSV file using the scavetool command line?
