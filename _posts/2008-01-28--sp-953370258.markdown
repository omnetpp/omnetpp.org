excerpt: "<p><b>ACID Sim Tools</b> is an interactive and batch-mode simulation tool
  (and framework) developed by Anakreon Mentis, Panagiotis Katsaros and Lefteris Angelis
  at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki for the performance evaluation of different
  combinations of concurrency control, atomic commit processing and recovery protocols
  (and protocol parameters), based on a minimal set of assumptions for an object-based
  computational model. The tool produces metrics that provide insight into the most
  influential performance and availability trade-offs that arise in distributed transaction
  processing architectures. Documentation and source code is available at their <a
  href=\"http://mathind.csd.auth.gr/acid/html/index.html\">ACID web site</a>.</p>\r\r<p>The
  simulator will also be presented at <a href=\"http://www.simulationworks.org/techprog.shtml\">SimulationWorks
  2008</a> conference, which is co-located with the Simutools 2008 conference and
  the <a href=\"http://www.omnet-workshop.org\">OMNeT++ 2008 workshop</a>.</p>"
