    We are excited to announce a new interactive resource for the community: AI-powered documentation for OMNeT++ and INET. Hosted at https://ai.omnetpp.org and https://ai.inet.omnetpp.org, this tool allows you to chat with the documentation, ask follow-up questions, and explore complex topics interactively.

We are excited to announce a new resource for the OMNeT++ community: AI-powered, interactive documentation hosted at DeepWiki. This new tool is available for both [OMNeT++](https://ai.omnetpp.org) and the [INET Framework](https://ai.inet.omnetpp.org).

## Not Just Static Pages

This is not just a static set of AI-generated pages. The platform is **interactive**, meaning you can engage in a dialogue with the documentation. If a concept isn't clear, you can ask follow-up questions, drill down into implementation details, or discuss specific scenarios that are often hard to piece together from traditional manuals.

## Why use it?

*   **Interactive Learning**: Ask specific questions and get tailored answers instead of searching through keywords.
*   **Grounded Answers**: The AI's responses are grounded in the actual codebase and documentation, making it easy to verify information and see exactly where specific details come from.
*   **Deep Dives**: Explore the model structure and logic by asking the AI to explain complex components or relationships.
*   **Problem Solving**: Discuss specific design problems or implementation details that might not be explicitly covered in standard guides.

## Example Questions to Try

Here are a few examples of what you can ask to get started:

*   *How can I limit the simulation time?*
*   *How to draw a map as a background for my model?*
*   *What is the best way to communicate with a real world hardware device from a simulation?*
*   *How to implement process based communication?*

We encourage everyone to explore these new sites and leverage the interactive capabilities to improve your simulation workflow.
