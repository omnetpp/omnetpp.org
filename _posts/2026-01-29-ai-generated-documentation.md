We are excited to announce a new interactive resource for the community: AI-powered documentation for OMNeT++ and INET. Available at [https://ai.omnetpp.org](https://ai.omnetpp.org) and [https://ai-inet.omnetpp.org](https://ai-inet.omnetpp.org), this tool is hosted by DeepWiki and allows you to chat with the documentation, ask follow-up questions, and explore complex topics interactively.

## Not Just Static Pages

This is not just a static set of AI-generated pages. The platform is **interactive**, meaning you can engage in a dialogue with the documentation. If a concept isn't clear, you can ask follow-up questions, drill down into implementation details, or discuss specific scenarios that are often hard to piece together from traditional manuals.

## Why use it?

*   **Interactive Learning**: Ask specific questions and get tailored answers instead of searching through keywords.
*   **Grounded Answers**: The AI's responses are grounded in the actual codebase and documentation, making it easy to verify information and see exactly where specific details come from.
*   **Deep Dives**: Explore the model structure and logic by asking the AI to explain complex components or relationships.
*   **Problem Solving**: Discuss specific design problems or implementation details that might not be explicitly covered in standard guides.

## Example Prompts to Try:
Here are several technical prompts you can use to test the notebook's capabilities across different areas of the simulator:

### NED & Topology

> INET: Create a NED module for a wireless sensor node that includes a transceiver, a battery module, and an application layer. Show how to connect them using gates.

> OMNeT++: Explain the difference between types and submodules in a compound module. Can you give a code example of a parametric submodule?

### C++ & Simulation Kernel

> OMNeT++: How do I schedule a self-message to trigger an event every 0.5 seconds in my handleMessage function?

> OMNeT++: Write a C++ class that extends cSimpleModule and records a histogram of packet inter-arrival times.

### INET Framework Configuration

> INET: How do I configure omnetpp.ini to set up a static routing table for a network of 5 routers using the INET Framework?

> INET: What are the necessary parameters to enable 802.11g mode in Ieee80211Interface?

### Debugging & Analysis

> OMNeT++: I am getting a checkout error regarding 'simulation time limit reached'. How can I properly handle or extend the simulation time limit in the configuration file?

> OMNeT++How can I export my vector data to a CSV file using the scavetool command line?

We encourage everyone to explore these new sites and leverage the interactive capabilities to improve your simulation workflow.
