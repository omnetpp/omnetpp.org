  we made makemake generation a lot more flexible in the IDE, implemented frequently
  asked features in Tkenv (run until event, log  window filtering), and resolved several
  issues. We also created a Wiki page for OMNeT++ 4.0-related resources. [<a href="index.php?option=com_docman&task=cat_view&gid=1">Download</a>]
