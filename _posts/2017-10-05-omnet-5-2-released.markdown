We are happy to announce the release of OMNeT++ 5.2. Highlights of this release are 
the fine-tuning of result recording and processing (especially around weighted statistics); 
many bug fixes and improvements in Qtenv; makefile changes to allow DEBUG and RELEASE builds 
of models to co-exist, and several related changes in the IDE.
