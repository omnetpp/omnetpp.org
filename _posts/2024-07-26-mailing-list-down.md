We regret to inform you that a significant issue occurred last night, July 25. A large number of spam accounts were created on Google Groups, leading to the dispatch of over 5000 spam emails through our forum. This event has caused considerable inconvenience, and we deeply apologize for the disruption.

Unfortunately, due to this spam outbreak, Google has decided to ban our forum on their platform. This decision, while aimed at addressing the spam issue, has left us unable to continue using this email list to serve our community effectively.

### What Happened:
- **Spam Account Creation**: A large number of spam accounts were created on Google Groups.
- **Mass Spam Emails**: Over 5000 spam emails were sent through our forum.
- **Forum Ban**: In response, Google has banned our forum.

### Our Response:
- **Discontinuation of Forum**: To protect our users, we are forced to discontinue this forum.
- **Petition to Google**: We will petition Google to recover the archive of our mailing list to preserve the valuable knowledge it contains.

### Moving Forward:
We encourage all community discussions to take place on our new forum at [forum.omnetpp.org](https://forum.omnetpp.org). This platform will be our primary discussion forum moving forward.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding during this challenging time. We are committed to ensuring that our community continues to have a reliable and secure platform for discussions.

### Update:
As of 1st of September Google has reinstated our forum. We will keep it in read-only mode so that older discussions can still be accessed by search engines.

Thank you for your continued support.

The OMNeT++ Team
