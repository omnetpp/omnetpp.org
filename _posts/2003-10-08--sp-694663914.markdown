excerpt: "In the last months, the parallel simulation framework in OMNeT++ has been
  reimplemented at CTIE, Monash University, in preparation for doing large-scale IPv6
  simulations on supercomputing clusters. The paper describing the new parallel simulation
  architecture (as well as another one, about predicting parallel simulation performance)
  have been accepted as extended papers for ESS'2003.\rClick <a href=\"http://ctieware.eng.monash.edu.au/twiki/bin/view/Simulation/ParallelSimulation\">here</a>
  for more information."
