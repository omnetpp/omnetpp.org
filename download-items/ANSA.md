The ANSA (Automated Network Simulation and Analysis) project
is dedicated to the development of a variety of protocol models, based
on RFC specifications and/or reference implementations.
The ANSA package extends INET Framework with several protocol models.

ANSA is may be publicly used as the routing/switching baseline for further
research initiatives, i.e., in simulations proving (or disproving)
certain aspects of networking technologies (e.g., finding bottlenecks
and single-point of failures, configuration errors, faulty network states, etc.).

ANSA is a long-term project carried out by researchers and students
at Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic.
