The Quantum Internet Simulation Package (QuISP) is an event-driven simulation of
quantum repeater networks, which will be the foundation of the coming Quantum
Internet. QuISP's goal is to simulate a full Quantum Internet consisting of up
to 100 networks of up to 100 nodes each. Its focus is on protocol design and
emergent behavior of complex, heterogeneous networks at large scale, while
keeping the physical layer as realistic as possible.

QuISP is a product of the Advancing Quantum Architecture (AQUA) research group
headed by Prof. Rodney Van Meter, at Keio University's Shonan Fujisawa Campus,
Fujisawa, Japan. See http://aqua.sfc.wide.ad.jp and the list of Authors.
