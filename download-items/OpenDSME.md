openDSME is an open source portable implementation of IEEE 802.15.4 DSME,
developed at the Institute of Telematics at Hamburg University of Technology.
The INET-DSME subproject provides code to integrate openDSME in the OMNeT++
simulator by using the INET framework.

DSME itself is a recent extension of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The IEEE
802.15.4 was recently extended by several techniques that allow reliable data
transmission for critical applications, such as industrial plants. Deterministic
and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (DSME) allows for distributed assignment
of time slots on multiple channels.
