OS³, the Open Source Satellite Simulator, was developed as a framework for
simulating various kinds of satellite-based communication, based on OMNeT++. The
aim was to create a platform that makes evaluating satellite communication
protocols as easy as possible. OS³ is also be able to automatically import real
satellite tracks and weather data to simulate conditions at a certain point in
the past or in the future, and offer powerful visualization.

OS³ enables a comfortable and thorough analysis of complex scenarios which may
be infeasible to test in reality. Starting anywhere from calculating attenuation
losses for earth-bound receivers up to complex mobility scenarios, the variety
of topics is only limited by creativity. For example, users are able to test new
protocols or satellite orbits and evaluate the resulting performance pertaining
to SNR, bit error rate, packet loss, round trip time, jitter, reachability, and
other measures.

OS³ was developed at the Communication Networks Institute, TU Dortmund, Germany.
