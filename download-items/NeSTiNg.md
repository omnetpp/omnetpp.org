**Note:** This repository is no longer actively maintained. We recommend using
the INET Framework for new TSN simulation projects instead. INET Framework,
starting with version 4.4, contains substantial support for TSN modeling, with
documentation and showcase example simulations.

NeSTiNg is a simulation model for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). It uses
the INET Framework and enhances it by TSN-capable components.
The model was initially developed by a group of students during a curricular
project and is continuously extended at the Distributed Systems group of IPVS,
University of Stuttgart.

David Hellmanns, one of the simulation authors, presented NeSTiNg at the
September 2018 IEEE 802.1 Working Group interim meeting in Oslo, Norway;
