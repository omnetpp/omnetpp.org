**Note:** This project is in maintenance mode. We recommend using
the INET Framework for new TSN simulation projects instead. INET Framework,
starting with version 4.4, contains substantial support for TSN modeling, with
documentation and showcase example simulations.

CoRE4INET is an extension to the INET Framework for the event-based simulation
of real-time Ethernet in the OMNeT++ simulation system.

CoRE4INET supports:
- TTEthernet (AS6802)
- IEEE 802.1 Audio Video Bridging (AVB) / Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)
- IEEE 802.1Q / IEEE P802.1p VLANs and Priorities
