**Note:** This repository is no longer actively maintained. We recommend using
the INET Framework for new WSN and BAN simulations. INET implements most of
Castalia's features, including sophisticated radio modeling, clock drift
modeling, 802.15.4 and other protocols.

Castalia is a simulator for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Body Area Networks
(BAN) and generally networks of low-power embedded devices, developed by
Thanassis Boulis in the Networked Systems theme at NICTA from 2007.

Castalia is used by researchers and developers to test their distributed
algorithms and/or protocols in realistic wireless channel and radio models, with
a realistic node behavior especially relating to access of the radio.

Castalia's salient features include: model for temporal variation of path loss,
fine-grain interference and RSSI calculation, physical process modeling, node
clock drift, and several popular MAC protocols implemented. Castalia is highly
parametric. It provides tools to help run large parametric simulation studies,
process and visualize the results.
