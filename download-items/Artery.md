Artery enables V2X simulations based on ETSI ITS-G5 protocols like GeoNetworking and BTP.
Single vehicles can be equipped with multiple ITS-G5 services through Artery's middleware,
which also provides common Facilities for these services.

Artery started as an extension of the Veins framework but can be used
independently nowadays. Please refer to its documentation for details about Veins.
