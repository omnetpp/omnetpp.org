Artery enables V2X simulations based on ETSI ITS-G5 protocols like GeoNetworking and BTP.
Single vehicles can be equipped with multiple ITS-G5 services through Artery's middleware,
which also provides common Facilities for these services.

Artery started as an extension of the Veins framework but can be used
independently nowadays.
