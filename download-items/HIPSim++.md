HIPSim++ is a Host Identity Protocol (HIP) implementation for INET/OMNeT++,
developed to provide a flexible toolset for testing and validation of HIP and
its extensions. HIPSim++ is fully OMNeT++ 4.x compatible as it is built on the
top of the 20090325 version of INET , and also uses the xMIPv6 additions created
at the Dortmund University of Technology.
