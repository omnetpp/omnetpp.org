space_Veins is an extension of Veins which integrates satellites as additional
communication partners in vehicular networks. By using Veins, the discrete event
simulator OMNeT++ and the road traffic simulator SUMO are used in order to
simulate vehicular networks. In addition, space_Veins provides OMNeT++ modules
for modeling satellites. The satellitesâ€™ mobility is based on the SGP4 model
which can calculate orbits of satellites based on NASA/NORAD Two-Line Element
sets.
