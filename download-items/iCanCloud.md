iCanCloud is a simulation platform aimed at modeling and simulating cloud computing
systems, which is targeted to those users who deal closely with those kinds of
systems. The main objective of iCanCloud is to predict the trade-offs between
cost and performance of a given set of applications executed in a specific
hardware, and then provide to users useful information about such costs.
However, iCanCloud can be used by a wide range of users, from basic active users
to developers of large distributed applications.
