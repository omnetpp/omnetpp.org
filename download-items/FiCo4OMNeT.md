**Note:** This project is in maintenance mode.

FiCo4OMNeT implements fieldbus communication. At this point the model consists
of two communication technologies â€“ CAN and FlexRay. Both of them are
implemented according to the specification with some adaptions to fit in
the simulation environment.

Implemented by the CoRE (Communication over Realtime Ethernet) research group
with support from the INET (Internet Technologies) research group at the HAW
Hamburg (Hamburg University of Applied Sciences). See also the related project
Core4INET.
