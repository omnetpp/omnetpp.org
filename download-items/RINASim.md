RINASim is a stand-alone OMNeT++ model framework for the simulation of
RINA-based networks. RINA (Recursive InterNetwork Architecture) itself
is a new (and complete) clean-slate architecture that tries to touch
and codify every part of communication within computer networks.

The main purpose is to offer the community with reliable and the most up-to-date
tool (in the sense of RINA specification compliance) for simulating RINA-based
computer networks. RINASim at its current state represents an entirely working
implementation of the simulation environment for RINA. The simulator contains
all mechanisms of RINA according to the current specification.
RINASim does not depend on INET or any other external library.

RINASim was developed at Brno University of Technology. The developmnent
started as one of the FP7 EU PRISTINE deliverables, and continues beyond
the end of the project.
