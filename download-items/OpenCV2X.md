OpenCV2X is an open source implementation of the 3GPP standard CV2X (Rel 14)
Mode 4. It is based on an extended version of the SimuLTE OMNeT++ simulator
which enables LTE network simulations.

Two variants are available. The first integrates with the Artery framework to
provide full ITS-G5 standardisation across the entire communication stack. The
second integrates with Veins only. (Note: the GitHub URL points to the repository
containing the Artery variant only. A visit the project page to access the other
variant and release tarballs.)
