MOSAIC ([alternative web site](https://eclipse.dev/mosaic/)) is a multi-scale
and multi-domain co-simulation framework for the assessment of new solutions for
connected and automated mobility. The Open Source version Eclipse MOSAIC offers
everything you need to assess smart mobility scenarios, while the enhanced
version MOSAIC Extended provides further tools and models, such as the vehicle
dynamics simulator PHABMACS. Vehicle movements and sophisticated communication
technologies like Vehicle-2-X communication and cellular networks can be modeled
in detail.

MOSAIC uses an ambassador concept inspired by some fundamental concepts of the
High Level Architecture (HLA). MOSAIC supports:

- the traffic simulators SUMO, PHABMACS and CARLA
- the communication simulators ns-3, OMNeT++, SNS
- several visualization and analysis tools

The project was initially developed under the name VSimRTI. Since October 2020,
it is distributed as Eclipse MOSAIC under the Eclipse Public License. MOSAIC is
developed at the Daimler Center for Automotive Information Technology
Innovations (DCAITI) at TU Berlin.
