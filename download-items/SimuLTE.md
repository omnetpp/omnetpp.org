**Note:** SimuLTE has been superseded by Simu5G, which contains support for
both the LTE and 5G protocol stack.

SimuLTE is an innovative simulation tool that enables complex system-level
performance evaluation of LTE and LTE Advanced networks (3GPP Release 8
and beyond) on the OMNeT++ framework. SimuLTE is fully customizable
via a simple pluggable interface, and allows one to extend it with
new algorithms and protocols.

SimuLTE is built on the INET Framework, and extends it with LTE user plane
protocols. eNodeB and UE models are provided. SimuLTE also includes a
form-based configuration editor.

SimuLTE was developed at University of Pisa, Italy.
