Plexe is an extension of the popular Veins vehicular network simulator which permits
the realistic simulation of platooning (i.e., automated car-following) systems.
It features realistic vehicle dynamics and several cruise control models, permitting
the analysis of control systems, large-scale and mixed scenario, as well as networking
protocols and cooperative maneuvers.
