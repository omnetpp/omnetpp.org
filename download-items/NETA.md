NETwork Attacks (NETA) is a framework devised to simulate attacks in
heterogeneous networks using OMNeT++ and the INET-Framework. NETA is aimed to be
an useful tool in the network security field. This tool could make easy to
demonstrate the effectiveness of defense security techniques or solutions
against network attacks as well as for comparing the capabilities of different
defense techniques.
