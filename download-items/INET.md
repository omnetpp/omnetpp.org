INET Framework is an open-source model library for the OMNeT++ simulation
environment. It provides protocols, agents and other models for researchers and
students working with communication networks. INET is especially useful when
designing and validating new protocols, or exploring new or exotic scenarios.

INET contains models for the Internet stack (TCP, UDP, IPv4, IPv6, OSPF, BGP,
etc.), wired and wireless link layer protocols (Ethernet, PPP, IEEE 802.11,
etc), support for mobility, MANET protocols, DiffServ, MPLS with LDP and RSVP-TE
signalling, several application models, and many other protocols and components.

Several other simulation frameworks take INET as a base, and extend it into
specific directions, such as vehicular networks, overlay/peer-to-peer networks,
or LTE.
