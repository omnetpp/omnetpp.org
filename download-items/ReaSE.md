The ReaSE framework provides a graphical user interface for generation of NED
files including a realistic topology and necessary traffic generation entities.
In addition, OMNeT++ and the INET framework are extended in a way that
hierarchical routing and traffic generation are enabled within a user's
simulation model.

ReaSE is developed at the Institute of Telematics, University of Karlsruhe.
