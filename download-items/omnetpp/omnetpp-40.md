This is a major revision of the whole simulation platform, with fundamental changes in nearly every component.
With the new Eclipse-based IDE, greatly enhanced NED language and simulation kernel, and tons of other
improvements, 4.0 is guaranteed to redefine the way you do simulations with OMNeT++, and it will open
up new horizons.
